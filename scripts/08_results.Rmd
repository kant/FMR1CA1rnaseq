# No significant pre-training group differences

First I examined the data to determine if the groups were different prior to experiencing shock. I found that all groups where equal in the proportion of time spent in four quadrants of the arena (**Figure 2.2A**). There was no significant interaction effect of geneotype and training on pre-training proportion of time spent in the shock zone (mean = 0.24, F(3,35) = 0.132 p = 0.94), clockwise (mean =  0.26, F(3,35) = 0.660, p = 0.58), opposite (mean = 0.21, F(3,35) = 1.312, p = 0.29), or counter clockwise (mean =  0.28, F(3,35) = 0.816, p = 0.49). 

There was also no significant effect of geneotype, training, or the interaction on pre-training number of entrances (**Figure 2.2B**) or path to the first entrance (**Figure 2.2C**), which are two measures that are used to identify the avoidance strategy. The was no significant mian effect or interaction between number of entrances (mean = 28.58, F(3,35) = 1.643,  p = 0.20) or path to the 1st entrance (mean = 0.42, F(3,35) = 0.165, p = 0.92)

##### A) This graph shows that all groups of mice spend ~ 25% of their time equally across four quadrants of the arena during the pre-training session (pink: future shock zone, dark green: clockwise, green: opposite the shock zone, light green: counter clockwise). B) Pre-training number of entrances into the shock zone and C) path to first entrance are not sinificantly different between treatment groups and genotypes (dark grey: yoked-consistent, red: consistently-trained, light grey: yoked-conflict, peach: conflict-trained).

# The training group has larger effect than genotype on distribution of time spent

After confirming equal variation amoung groups during pre-training, I asked if there were groups differences in the distribution of time spent during training, retest, conflict session (**Fig. 2.3**). Using a linear model I found that time spent in the shock zone is not significantly influenced by genotype (F= (1,286) = 1.49, p = 0.22) by is influenced by training (F= (2,286) = 128.58, p < 0). This linear model with training, genotype, and the interactino expalins 73% of the variation in time spent in the shock zone. Among only the yoked groups, there is no effect of genotype (F= (1,80) = 0.040, p =  0.84) or training (F= (1,80) = 3.438, p = 0.067) on time spent in the shock zone.


![Figure 2.3. Proportion of time spent in in the arena with the shock on.](../figures/fig1-06.png)

##### The aveage proportion of time spent in each 60 degree guadrant of the arena was caluculated or each group for each session with the shock was on (T1,T2,T3: training sessions 1-3; R1: retest; C1, C2, C3: conflict training sessions; pink: future shock zone; dark green: clockwise; green: opposite the shock zone; light green: counter clockwis ). For trained mice, mice are expected to spend very little time in the shock zone (<0.4%) and to equally split their time between the three remaining quadrants (~32% each). For yoked mice, time spent is expected to be equally distributed across all four quatrants (~25% each).  

The differences between the conflict and consistnetly trained mice are appearent during the three conflict training sessions (**Fig 2.4**). Both consitent and conflict groups avoid the shock zone, spending less than 2% of thier time in the shock zone (mean = 0.019, F (1,78) = 1.2166, p = 0.27). Consiently trained groups spend significantly less time clockwise of the shock zone than conflict trained groups (F (1,78) = 23.3405, p <  0.001). Consistnetly trainined groups spend more time in the counter clockwise zone than conflict trained mice (F (1,78) = 8.2837, p = 0.005). FMR1-K0 mice spend less time opposite of the shock zone (F (1,78) = 4.7442, p = 0.032)

On day 1, differences in time/path to the 1st entrance between WT yoked and WT trained are minimal. The FMR1 data are all over the place with yoked groups showing highly variable time/path to the first entrance, while conflict and consistent show minor increases in path/time to the entrance. 

PRESUMABLY THEY ARE LESS ACTIVE (bad luck) - tells us we should use measures that are less sensitive to amount of movement since that might differ in KO (i.e. path to first enter better than time to first enter; entrances/path moved better than entrances)

q2) Do the groups differ in avoidance during training to the initial shock zone? On day 1, differences in time/path to the 1st entrance between WT yoked and WT trained are minimal. The FMR1 data are all over the place with yoked groups showing highly variable time/path to the first entrance, while conflict and consistent show minor increases in path/time to the entrance. 

The groups look pretty similar across T1-T3 providing no evidence of acquiring place memory. Because entrances decrease in trained compared to yoked, together these data suggest the mice don’t rely on place memory from before the trial, instead they get shocked first (by chance) and then adopt a strategy to reduce entrances that does not seem a place strategy by T3


Top) Consistently trained mice (red) from both WT (solid lines, filled circles) and FMR1-KO (dashes lines, open circles) make fewer entrances into the shock zone than yoked-mice (grey). Bottom) Conflict trained mice (pink) from both WT (solid lines, filled circles) and FMR1-KO (dashes lines, open circles) learn to avoid the initial and the conflicting shock zones. Data are reported as mean +/- SEM. A Mann-Whitney statistical test shows that there are no significant differences due to genotype for any treatment at any time point (as evidenced by all overlapping standard error bars). Inserts) The pie-shaped shaded regions of the inserts highlight the region used to count the number of entrances. Sample sizes for each treatment group and genotype are shown on the bottom right.



This is how I am currently conceptualizing the results.

WT and FMR1-KO show evidence of differential gene expression in the CA1
A)  The sample size for RNA-sequencing is 8 WT and 8 FMR1-KO tissues from the CA1 subfield from only the consistent-yoke group. B) Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes shows that only 13 genes are upregulated in response to FMR1KO while 16, including Fmr1, were downregulated in the CA1 subfield of yoked-consistent mice. C) A volcano plot shows that expression Ccnd2 and Fmr1 are highly upregulated in WT compared to FMR1-KO mice. Genes with negative log fold change value are more highly expressed in WT (dark grey filled circles) while genes with a positive log fold change value are more highly expressed in the Fmr1 mice (open circles). Genes that are not significantly expressed are shown in light grey.

Down-regulation of ion transport in the the the CA1 subfield 
Down-regulation of ion channel binding, receptor binding, calcium binding, metal ion membrane transport, calcium ion transmembrane transporter, delayed rectifier potassium channel, channel, cation channel, channel regulator, calmodulin binding, PDZ domain binding, structural molecular, and structural constituent of ribosome. On the plot, different fonts are used to indicate significance (bold: p < 0.01, regular: p < 0.05) and color indicates enrichment with either up (red) or down (blue) regulated genes. The fraction next to GO category name indicates the fraction of "good" genes that exceed the p-value cutoff. The tree on the plot is hierarchical clustering of GO categories based on shared genes. Categories with no branch length between them are subsets of each other.



CA3-CA1 synaptic strength is not altered by genotype or place avoidance training.
I did not observe reduction in synaptic strength at the CA3-CA1 synapse (as measured by maximum fEPSP slope) with avoidance learning or with FMR1-KO. The interaction between Genotype and Training Group was not significant, and Genotype alone was not significant. Violin plots are colored by treatment group and shaded according to genotype.
