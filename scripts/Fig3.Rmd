Fig. 3. The proportion of time spent in in the arena with the shock on.
The average proportion of time spent in each 60 degrees quadrant of the arena was calculated or each group for each session with the shock was on (T1, T2, T3: training sessions 1-3; R1: retest; C1, C2, C3: conflict training sessions; pink: future shock zone; dark green: clockwise; green: opposite the shock zone; light green: counter clockwise). For trained mice, mice are expected to spend very little time in the shock zone (<0.4%) and to equally split their time between the three remaining quadrants (~32% each). For yoked mice, time spent is expected to be evenly distributed across all four quadrants (~25% each).

These are the packages required for making the figures and doing stats. 

```{r setup, warning = F, message = F}
library(dplyr) # for subsetting data 
library(car) # for fancy ANOVA
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(cowplot) # for "easier"" ggplot themes

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = '../figures/01_behavior/')
```

This chuck of code is for loading and formatting the dataframes.

```{r loaddata, message=F, warning = F}
behavior <- read.csv("../results/behaviordata.csv", header = T)
behavior$APA2 <- factor(behavior$APA2, levels = c("yoked-consistent","consistent", "yoked-conflict","conflict")) ## relevel then rename factors treatment
behavior$Genotype <- factor(behavior$Genotype, levels = c("WT","FMR1KO")) # relevel genotype

proptime <- read.csv("../results/behaviorproptime.csv", header = T)
proptime$APA2 <- factor(proptime$APA2, levels = c("yoked-consistent","consistent", "yoked-conflict","conflict")) ## relevel then rename factors treatment
proptime$Genotype <- factor(proptime$Genotype, levels = c("WT","FMR1KO")) # relevel genotype
proptime$variable <- factor(proptime$variable, 
          levels = c("pTimeTarget", "pTimeCCW", "pTimeOPP", "pTimeCW"))
```

This is for making the figures that show propotion of time spent in each quadrant during the training and retest sessions only. I had to make two figures so that I put the expected percent time as dashed lines on the y-axis with `geom_hline`. 

```{r fig3}
timespent1 <- proptime %>%
  filter(APA2 %in% c("consistent","conflict")) %>%
  filter(TrainSessionComboNum != 1, TrainSessionComboNum != 9 ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TrainSessionComboNum, y = value,fill = variable)) + 
    geom_bar(position = "fill",stat = "identity") +
    scale_x_continuous(name="Training Session", 
                       breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),
                       labels = c( "P", "T1", "T2", "T3",
                                   "Rt", "C1", "C2","C3", 
                                   "Rn")) +
  facet_wrap(~APA2*Genotype, nrow=1) +
  theme_cowplot(font_size = 8, line_size = 0.25) +  theme(legend.title=element_blank()) +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Proportion of Time Spent",
                     breaks = c(0.32,0.64, 0.96)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#d01c8b", "#e5f5e0" ,"#a1d99b", "#31a354")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=c(0.32,0.64, 0.96), color="black" , linetype="dashed") 
timespent1

timespent2 <- proptime %>%
  filter(APA2 %in% c("yoked-consistent","yoked-conflict")) %>%
    filter(TrainSessionComboNum != 1, TrainSessionComboNum != 9 ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TrainSessionComboNum, y = value,fill = variable)) + 
    geom_bar(position = "fill",stat = "identity") +
    scale_x_continuous(name="Training Session", 
                       breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9),
                       labels = c( "P", "T1", "T2", "T3",
                                   "Rt", "C1", "C2","C3", 
                                   "Rn")) +
  facet_wrap(~APA2*Genotype, nrow=1) +

  theme(legend.position="none") +
  scale_y_continuous(name= "Proportion of Time Spent") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#d01c8b", "#e5f5e0" ,"#a1d99b", "#31a354")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept=c(0.25,0.50, 0.75), color="black" , linetype="dashed")

The statistics on time spend during the training and retest session (but not the first and last pre-training and retest sessions).

```{r statistics}
PathNumStats <- behavior  %>% 
  filter(TrainSessionComboNum != "1", TrainSessionComboNum != "9") 
summary(aov(pTimeTarget ~  APA2 * Genotype, data=PathNumStats))
summary(aov(pTimeOPP ~  APA2 * Genotype, data=PathNumStats))
summary(aov(pTimeTarget ~  APA2 * Genotype, data=PathNumStats))
summary(aov(pTimeCCW ~  APA2 * Genotype, data=PathNumStats))

timespent <- behavior %>%
    filter(TrainSessionComboNum %in% c("2", "3", "4", "5" ,"6", "7", "8")) 
Anova(lm(data = timespent, pTimeTarget ~ Genotype * APA2 ), type = 3)

timespent <- behavior %>%
    filter(TrainSessionComboNum %in% c("2", "3", "4", "5" ,"6", "7", "8")) %>%
  filter(APA2 %in% c("yoked-consistent", "yoked-conflict"))
Anova(lm(data = timespent, pTimeTarget ~ Genotype * APA2 ), type = 3)

timespent <- behavior %>%
    filter(TrainSessionComboNum %in% c("2", "3", "4")) %>%
  filter(APA2 %in% c("consistent", "conflict"))
summary(aov(data =  timespent, pTimeTarget ~ Genotype * APA2 ))
Anova(lm(data = timespent, pTimeTarget ~ Genotype * APA2 ), type = 3)

```
